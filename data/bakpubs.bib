  volume = {14},
  issn = {1814-9332},
  doi = {10.5194/cp-14-1653-2018},
  abstract = {Paleotemperature reconstructions are essential for distinguishing anthropogenic climate change from natural variability. An emerging method in paleolimnology is the use of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in sediments to reconstruct temperature, but their application is hindered by a limited understanding of their sources, seasonal production, and transport. Here, we report seasonally resolved measurements of brGDGT production in the water column, in catchment soils, and in a sediment core from Basin Pond, a small, deep inland lake in Maine, USA. We find similar brGDGT distributions in both water column and lake sediment samples but the catchment soils have distinct brGDGT distributions suggesting that (1) brGDGTs are produced within the lake and (2) this in situ production dominates the down-core sedimentary signal. Seasonally, depthresolved measurements indicate that most brGDGT production occurs in late fall, and at intermediate depths (18\textendash{}30 m) in the water column. We utilize these observations to help interpret a Basin Pond brGDGT-based temperature reconstruction spanning the past 900 years. This record exhibits trends similar to a pollen record from the same site and also to regional and global syntheses of terrestrial temperatures over the last millennium. However, the Basin Pond temperature record shows higher-frequency variability than has previously been captured by such an archive in the northeastern United States, potentially attributed to the North Atlantic Oscillation and volcanic or solar activity. This first brGDGTbased multi-centennial paleoreconstruction from this region contributes to our understanding of the production and fate of brGDGTs in lacustrine systems.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to climate forcing is of key importance in assessing its contribution to past and future sea level rise. Surface mass loss occurs during summer, and accounting for temperature seasonality is critical in simulating ice sheet evolution and in interpreting glacial landforms and chronologies. Ice core records constrain the timing and magnitude of climate change but are largely limited to annual mean estimates from the ice sheet interior. Here we merge ice core reconstructions with transient climate model simulations to generate Greenland-wide and seasonally resolved surface air temperature fields during the last deglaciation. Greenland summer temperatures peak in the early Holocene, consistent with records of ice core melt layers. We perform deglacial Greenland ice sheet model simulations to demonstrate that accounting for realistic temperature seasonality decreases simulated glacial ice volume, expedites the deglacial margin retreat, mutes the impact of abrupt climate warming, and gives rise to a clear Holocene ice volume minimum.},

  abstract = {Based on modeling motivated by new GPS and radio-echo sounding surveys, a few-kilometers-long zone of Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, just inland of the grounding line has higher basal shear stress than the ice farther upstream or the freely slipping ice shelf downstream. Data from this zone show a few-meter-high upwarp of the surface overlying a large fold extending through all internal radar layers observed. Flowband modeling shows that the fold can be generated by decreased basal lubrication beneath the upwarp. Basal topography alone cannot create this fold. Physical modeling and available data suggest that low-amplitude tidal flexure of the ice shelf extends a few kilometers inland. Downward flexing of this grounded ice from the rising tide would compact subglacial till, resulting in higher basal shear stress. This result suggests that important processes influencing grounding line stability are not included in modern whole-ice-sheet models.},
